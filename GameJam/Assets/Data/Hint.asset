  hintitems:
  - Location: 1
    hints:
    - You sit in the lounge, pretending to enjoy a bestselling thriller novel. You
      lose yourself reading the book however, and barely miss someone entering the
      crime scene. Their hair and shape of their head reminds you of <RPNoMurNoCrrNoGos>.
    - Sitting in the lounge, you enjoy some mediocre appetizers and try to take in
      the atmosphere. You find <RPNoCrrNoGos> is having a very vested interest in
      <GOS>...
    - You make some small talks with whoever you find to get information. You try
      to understand what a German developer is banging on about, when you spot <RPNoCrrNoGos>
      walking around anxiously...
    - "(if VGA cable not the WEP) You ask the staff if they have any spare VGA cables.
      They laugh in your face and ask you if it\u2019s still 2006 and nobody told
      them. No one else has these cables. A VGA cable could not be the murder weapon."
  - Location: 2
    hints:
    - "You rush to the cafeteria to interrogate the crew. Fearing you might not get
      anything useful, a barista motions towards <RPNoCrrNoMur>, as they\u2019re taking
      a selfie and calmly drinking coffee. No way they could have done it at this
      time frame."
    - "It\u2019s just in time for people to take a break, you think. As if on cue,
      <RPNoCrrNoMur> comes in with a congoer. They stay here, order some coffee, and
      keep talking until the time of the murder. Yup, they\u2019re not killers."
    - "(if poisoned coffee not the WEP) In desperation, and as a brute-force way of
      checking your suspicions, you drink coffee straight from the pot. It\u2019s
      actually pretty bad, but not poisoned. Indeed, Poisoned Coffee can be ruled
      it out as the murder weapon."
  - Location: 3
    hints:
    - Upon visiting the server room, you immediately notice some things that obviously
      should be in a proper server room are missing. The only items left behind are
      <WEP> and <WEP>... No time for the killer to take them; these can be dismissed
      as murder weapons.
    - "A staff member escorts you inside. Both of you attempt to look for clues. It\u2019s
      cold. It\u2019s loud. You want out of there, now. But then you finally manage
      to get somewhere: <MURDERWEAPON>, <WEP> and <WEP>  are mysteriously missing\u2026"
    - "(if Keyboard is not the WEP) You quickly scout the place in search of conspicuously
      missing items. What you do find is a neat pile of keyboards, which a staff member
      assures you wasn\u2019t touched by any congoer. A keyboard as the murder weapon?
      Not likely."
  - Location: 4
    hints:
    - "First you hear singing, next the snack wagon comes rolling by. It is operated
      by Mario himself. Well, someone dressed as him, at least. You smile, as his
      joy fills you with warmth and determination. You find <RPNoCrrNoMur> enjoying
      their potato chips. Don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna murder today."
    - "You go up to a sponsor's panel, and ask the representative if he saw anything
      wrong. \u201CCome to think about it,\u201D he utters, \u201C<RPNoCrrNoMur> and
      <MUR> looked kinda odd.\u201D They went in and out of the murder area, he recalls.
      Hmm."
    - You watch a congoer play around in a virtual world, wearing a headset. A small
      crowd gathers around them, as they try to orient themselves. <RPNoCrrNoMur>  enjoying
      the show, up until the time of the murder. They appear to be clear.
  - Location: 5
    hints:
    - "You go out the door to get some fresh air. You\u2019ve had enough of this time
      travel crap, you say to yourself. As you bathe in the summer sun, you find <RPNoCrrNoMur>,<RPNoCrrNoMur>
      and <MUR> leaving the venue. You try following one of them, but then you are
      alerted that one of them ran back and commited the murder."
    - "There is an impromptu meetup outside, where anyone can step up and talk about
      whatever they want. <RP> comes up and talks about violent video games with a
      weirdly roaring passion. It\u2019s creepy, but not incriminating."
  - Location: 6
    hints:
    - You notice a <WEP>  in the corner of the room, and graciously weep a single
      manly tear as a congoer accidentally destroys it while walking around in a motion
      capture suit.
    - "You read the sign on the table: \u201CCaught in the VR world. Email me items\u201D.
      You chuckle to yourself as you send a photo of <WEP> on the table. It stays
      there after the murder."
    - "You clearly witness <MUR>, <RPNoCrrNoMur> and <RPNoCrrNoMur> in the audience
      for a game design talk. You find yourself really getting into it, but as you
      remember why you\u2019re here, you find one of the three is mysteriously gone."
  - Location: 7
    hints:
    - "Tentatively, you enter the staff and volunteers room. A puzzled volunteer tries
      to tell you it\u2019s staff only, but you investigate anyway. It seems that
      throughout the murder, the <WEP> is still here. It\u2019s not the murder weapon,
      you deduce, and run away before the staff throw you out of the venue."
    - You come up to one of the organizers and ask to see the staff room. Inside you
      very easily spot a <WEP>, <WEP> and a <MURDERWEAPON>. After the murder however,
      you run back to find one of these items missing.
    - During a keynote, you sneak inside the staff room. Plowing through the maze
      of leftover coke and sandwiches, you find they have a <WEP>. No one came to
      get it, even at the time of the murder.
  - Location: 8
    hints:
    - You had no idea what to expect in the IT department, but you never know. You
      interview a confused, slouched IT woman who tells you a few people came in throughout
      the day and asked for <WEP>, <WEP> and <MURDERWEAPON>.
    - "Under the guise of asking a technical question, you peek inside the IT room.
      Inside, you clearly see a well-stored <WEP>, and it couldn\u2019t be reached
      by congoers."
  - Location: 9
    hints:
    - "You want to find that murderer with their pants down. You head to the restroom,
      and very quickly realize <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos> is having some \u2018bowel issues\u2019
      in the nearby stall. These... \u2018issues\u2019 continue into the time of the
      murde"
    - "You stand guard at the restroom, making notes of the people going in and out.
      You recognize <RPNoCrrNoMur>, <RPNoCrrNoMur> and <Mur>. Just as you were about
      to leave, you catch one of those running towards the crime scene. You don\u2019t
      catch who exactly."
  - Location: 10
    hints:
    - Finally, some damn peace and quiet. Just as you were about to bathe in the warm
      air and cool wind, you find <MUR>, <RPnoCrrNoMur> and <RPnoCrrNoMur>, <RPnoCrrNoMur>
      doing the same. It then comes to light that one of them may have murdered <GHOST>.
    - Away from the neverending noise and flashy screens, you lay on the soft grass
      and try to calmly assess the situation. You stare deeper into the gardens, and
      you spot (RPNoCrr) and (random <RandomAccomplice> rushing back inside. Odd,
      but not very incriminating.
