    hints:
    - You sit in the lounge, pretending to enjoy a bestselling thriller novel. You
      lose yourself reading the book however, and barely miss someone entering the
      crime scene. Their hair and shape of their head reminds you of <RPNoCrrNoGos>.
    - Sitting in the lounge, you enjoy some mediocre appetizers and try to take in
      the atmosphere. You find <MUR> and <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> are having a very vested
      interest in <GHOST>...
    - You make some small talks with whoever you find to get information. You try
      to understand what a German developer is banging on about, when you spot <RPNoCrrNoGos>
      walking around anxiously...

    hints:
    - "You rush to the cafeteria to interrogate the crew. Fearing you might not get
      anything useful, a barista motions towards <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1>, as they\u2019re
      taking a selfie and calmly drinking coffee. Doesn't look like a murder thing."
    - "It\u2019s just in time for people to take a break, you think. As if on cue,
      <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> and <MUR> come in with a congoer. They stay here, order
      some coffee, and leave. Both were found next to the crime scene at the same
      time."

    hints:
    - Upon visiting the server room, you immediately notice some things that obviously
      should be in a proper server room are missing. The only item left behind is
      <WEP>... No time for the killer to take it.
    - "A staff member escorts you inside. Both of you attempt to look for clues. You
      want out of there, now. Then you finally manage to get somewhere: a <MURDERWEAPON>
      and a <WEP> are mysteriously missing\u2026 One of them is the murder weapon."

    hints:
    - "First you hear singing, next the snack wagon comes rolling by. It is operated
      by Super Mario himself. You smile, as his joy fills you with warmth and determination.
      You find <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> enjoying their potato chips. Don\u2019t think
      they\u2019re gonna murder today."
    - "You go up to a sponsor's panel, and ask the representative if he saw anything
      wrong. \u201CCome to think about it,\u201D he utters, \u201C<RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1>
      and <MUR> looked kinda odd.\u201D They went in and out of the murder area, he
      recalls. Hmm."

      looked kinda odd.\x1D They went in and out of the murder area, he recalls. Hmm."
    - You watch a congoer play around in a virtual world, wearing a headset. A small
      crowd gathers around them, as the congoer tries, and fails, to orient themselves.
      <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> is enjoying the show, up until the time of the murder.
      They appear to be clear.
  - Location: 5
    hints:
    - You go out the door to get some fresh air. As you bathe in the summer sun, you
      find <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1>,<RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos2> and <MUR> leaving the venue.
      You try following one of them, but then you are alerted that one of them ran
      back and commited the murder.

    - "There is an impromptu meetup outside, where anyone can step up and talk about
      whatever they want. <RPNoCrrNoGos> comes up and talks about violent video games
      with a weirdly roaring passion. It\u2019s creepy, but not incriminating."
  - Location: 6
    hints:
    - You notice a <WEP>  in the corner of the room, and graciously weep a single
      manly tear as a congoer accidentally destroys it while walking around in a motion
      capture suit. Please take a moment of silence in honor of its legacy.
    - "You read the sign on the table: \u201CCaught in a virtual world. Email me items\u201D.
      You chuckle to yourself as you send a photo of a <WEP> on the table. After the
      murder, you rush back and see that it hadn't moved an inch."
    - "You clearly witness <MUR>, <RPNoCrrNoMur> and <RPNoCrrNoMur> in the audience
      for a game design talk. You find yourself really getting into it, but as you
      remember why you\u2019re here, you find one of the three is mysteriously gone."

    hints:
    - "Tentatively, you enter the staff and volunteers room. A puzzled volunteer tries
      to tell you it\u2019s a staff only room, but you investigate anyway. It seems
      that throughout the murder, the <WEP> is still here. It\u2019s not the murder
      weapon, you deduce, and run away before the staff throw you out of the venue."
    - You come up to one of the organizers and ask to see the staff room. Inside you
      very easily spot a <WEP>, <WEP> and a <MURDERWEAPON>. After the murder however,
      you run back and understand someone took one of these items and killed <GHOST>.

    - During a keynote, you sneak inside the staff room. Plowing through the maze
      of leftover cola and sandwiches, you find they own a <WEP>. No one came to get
      it, even at the time of the murder.
  - Location: 8
    hints:
    - You had no idea what to expect from an IT department, but you never know. You
      interview a confused, slouched IT woman who tells you a few people came in throughout
      the day and asked for <WEP>, <WEP> and <MURDERWEAPON>.

    - "Under the guise of asking a technical question, you peek inside the IT room.
      Inside, you clearly see a well-stored <WEP>, and it couldn\u2019t be reached
      by congoers."

    hints:
    - "You want to find that murderer with their pants down. You head to the restroom,
      and very quickly realize <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> is having some \u2018bowel issues\u2019
      in the nearby stall. These... \u2018issues\u2019 continue into the time of the
      murde"

    - "You stand guard at the restroom, making notes of the people going in and out.
      You recognize <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1>, <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos2> and <MUR>. Just as
      you were about to leave, you catch one of those running towards the crime scene.
      You don\u2019t recognize anyone in particular."

    hints:
    - Finally, some damn peace and quiet. Just as you were about to bathe in the warm
      air and cool wind, you find <MUR>, <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> and <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos2>
      doing the same. It then comes to light that one of them may have murdered <GHOST>.

    - Away from the neverending noise and flashy screens, you lay on the soft grass
      and try to calmly assess the situation. You stare deeper into the gardens, and
      you spot <MUR> and <RPNoCrrNoMurNoGos1> rushing back inside. Odd, but not solid
      evidence.
