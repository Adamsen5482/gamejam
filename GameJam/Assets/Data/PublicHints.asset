  hints:
  - Marks on the ground indicate the murder weapon cannot be <WEP_NOTMURDER>.
  - "Considering the impact wounds on <GHOST>\u2019s body, we can safely rule out
    <WEP_NOTMURDER> as the murder weapon."
  - Blood patterns on the ground and walls indicate that <WEP_NOTMURDER> cannot be
    the murder weapon.
  - "<GHOST>\u2019s last text exchange with The Council indicated they fell into paranoia\u2026
    The only people they didn\u2019t think was conspiring against them is <NOTMURDERER>."
  - The murderer is <MURDER>! Atleast I think so.
  - The murderer is <NOTMURDERER>! Atleast I think so.
